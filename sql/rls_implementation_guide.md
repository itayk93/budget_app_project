# RLS Implementation Guide

## Summary
Your Supabase database had many tables marked as "Unrestricted" which is a critical security vulnerability. I've created a comprehensive solution to enable Row Level Security (RLS) properly.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Created RLS SQL Script
**File**: `sql/enable_rls_security.sql`
- Enables RLS on all critical tables
- Creates proper policies for user data isolation
- Ensures users can only access their own data

### 2. Updated Supabase Configuration
**File**: `server/config/supabase.js`
- Created dual client system:
  - **adminClient**: For operations that need to bypass RLS (stock prices, user creation)
  - **userClient**: For user-scoped operations with RLS protection
  - **createUserClient()**: Function to create authenticated user clients

### 3. Fixed Stock Price Services
**Files Updated**:
- `server/services/stockPriceService.js`
- `server/services/alphaVantageService.js`
- `server/services/supabase-modules/UserService.js`

All now use `adminClient` for operations that need to bypass RLS.

## Required Environment Variable
You need to add this to your `.env` file:
```
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

## Next Steps (CRITICAL)

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable
Add `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to your `.env` file with your Supabase anonymous key.

### Step 2: Run the RLS Script
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire content of `sql/enable_rls_security.sql`
3. Execute the script

### Step 3: Update Remaining User-Scoped Operations
The following files still need updating to use user context clients instead of admin client:

**High Priority Files** (will break with RLS):
- `server/services/supabase-modules/TransactionService.js`
- `server/services/supabase-modules/BudgetService.js`
- `server/services/supabase-modules/CategoryService.js`
- `server/routes/transactions.js`
- `server/routes/budgets.js`
- `server/routes/categories.js`

### Step 4: Update Route Middleware
Routes need to be updated to:
1. Extract JWT token from request headers
2. Create user context client: `createUserClient(token)`
3. Pass the user client to service functions

**Example Update Pattern**:
```javascript
// OLD - uses admin client (breaks with RLS for user data)
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('transactions')...

// NEW - uses user context client (RLS protected)
const userClient = createUserClient(req.user.token);
const { data, error } = await userClient.from('transactions')...
```

## Testing After Implementation

1. **Test User Data Isolation**: Verify users can only see their own transactions/budgets
2. **Test Stock Operations**: Verify stock prices still update (uses admin client)
3. **Test Authentication**: Verify login/signup still works
4. **Test Admin Operations**: Verify migrations and admin functions still work

## Security Benefits After Implementation

- ✅ Users cannot access other users' data
- ✅ Database level protection (not just application level)
- ✅ Stock market data remains globally accessible
- ✅ Admin operations can still bypass RLS when needed
- ✅ Proper JWT authentication enforcement

## Notes

The current implementation maintains backward compatibility by defaulting to `adminClient` for existing code. However, all user-scoped operations should be migrated to use `userClient` with proper JWT authentication for full RLS protection.
